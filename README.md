# fibonacci-sequence
fibonacci sequence algorithm app

just like fibonacci, you are given two integers and you should add them up until a given limit is reached.
so in the app, on the first input you provide an two integers seperated by a comma.
 the second input is the limit for the fibonacci sequence.
 
 the algorithm adds up the numbers untils the limit is reached and if the final value exceed s the limit,
 then it is popped off the returned array
 
 HAVE FUN!!!!
